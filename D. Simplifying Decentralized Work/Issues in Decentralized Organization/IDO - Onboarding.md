**IDO - Issues in Decentralized Organization**

The number one issue for a decentralized organization to be successful is onboarding. Newcomers discover your community everyday. The barriers to entry push those newcomers out before they even have a chance to get involved. 

### Things to consider with onboarding
1. Lower barriers - but don't overdo it and make it too simple. Some friction is good.
2. Use onboarding to filter in value aligned contributors, and filter out everyone else.
