Decentralized organizations need to reinvent the wheel of operating organizations.

Legacy organizations keep things simple by giving you managers who tell you what to do. What a great idea. Take away the freedom, creativity, and ingenuity of each human being, put them in a special box with a job title and watch them wither away. 

Decentralized organizations need a better way. We need to figure out from the ground up how we organize in a fashion that optimizes for fulfilling human lives filled with joy and fulfillment. 

This is a living document highlighting our research, observations, learnings, and experiments on the issues of decentralized organization.

### Onboarding 
Where can I help? How can I help? How do I know if my help is needed? Do I even have the skills necessary to help out? At what stage does a newcomer feel comfortable about their own skills will help out the community at large? ...

### Information Overload + Short Attention Spans
How many Discord servers are you in again? Only 50? Should be easy getting updates with at least 20 channels in each of them. 

You only check your Insta/Twitter/Facebook/Reddit for 100 times during the day? Good, such a low number. 

Scroll, scroll, scroll. I'm bored of this thing after spending 1 and a half seconds looking at it.

### Coordination Costs

## Organizational Structure
Once you take out the boss-employee relationship, you are left structureless. Or are you?
