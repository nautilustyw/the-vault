This guide explains how Multi Server Chat can be set and used.

1- You can invite the bot to your server from [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968959239219466300&permissions=141197569265&scope=bot). You can also see the bot's support page from [this link](https://discord.gg/xeHB53VYda).

2- After adding the bot you have to use command ``,,h``. This will prompt the screen shown below. You have to press on 'Setup'.

4- This will create a new category on your server called 'Multichat'. You can create any channel under this category. You have to be as specific as possible while creating the channel name. For example; channels like general and gaming are already present.

5- You can repeat the same steps in any server you want to connect. When you use the same channel name, those channels will be connected to each other from each server.
