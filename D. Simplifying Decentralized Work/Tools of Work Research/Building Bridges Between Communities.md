#work-tools #Discord 

In Discord everyone's first thought is to make sure their server is running smoothly. Doing so they miss out some important updates from other communities. In Littlefish we have tried to tackle this challenge by trying to find a way to connect these different servers with similar agendas.

We have noticed that even though we are joining other servers for cooperation we are losing track of what is happening there since there is generally more than enough notifications in your account.

We started to look for a tool inside Discord to sync channels but apparently Discord does not give its users this freedom. Naturally, after this we searched for bots and tried them out. In the end we have eliminated some bots from our list.
- [Connecty](https://top.gg/tr/bot/683004822202351927) - Relatively tough setup process, unstable bot connection
- [Disnet](https://top.gg/bot/666792286348247040) - Unstable bot connection
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/discord/integrations/discord/62302/copy-new-discord-channel-messages-to-another-channel) - Requires full administrator access (Not exactly a bot but it makes the job done)

We have tested two more bots that were a better fit to our needs.
- [ComBot](https://combot.xyz) -- [[How to use ComBot]]
- [Multi Server Chat](https://top.gg/bot/968959239219466300) -- [[How to use Multi Server Chat]]

You can simply click them and it will take you to their respective 'How to' pages.
