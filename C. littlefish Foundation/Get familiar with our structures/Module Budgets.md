Each proposal is made up of [[Modules]]. Each module has a specified budget. The sum of module budgets makes up the first part of the overall budget.

1.  **Personnel budget**
   
   Each module has a personnel budget and an operations budget. The personnel budget is the total estimated hours * the hourly rate for the module.
   
   The base hourly rate for LFF proposals is 50 USD. This is a living wage in most parts of the world. It will bring financial stability to participants.
   
   The hourly rate for a module may change from this default, based on the expertise needed. 
      
    
2. **Module operations budget**  
   
   Each module is allocated an extra budget sized at 1/5th of the personnel budget to enable operations.
   
   This budget is a pooled organization wide resource used to cover expenses. It will be used to purchase digital work tools like Zoom to be used by all members of LFF.
   
   A part of it will be spent with the discretion of the module team. For example, it can be used to pay for transportation, buy personal digital tools, purchase other teamsâ€™ Actions, etc.
