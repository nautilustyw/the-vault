### The times we live in
At **littlefish Foundation** we believe the world today is deeply flawed. We can all feel it. There is something deeply unsettling about the things we're experiencing. Despite major technological advances, we live in times of extreme unhappiness, deep divides in societies, and under multiple existential threats.

This is the background of our endeavor: [[1- The Meta|The Meta]]

Within this meta, we believe the core problem is centralization of society. Good news is: we have reached peak centralization. Governments and mega-corporations which control large parts of modern life have reached their peak powers. With the [[2- The Digital and Beyond|digital revolution]] we now are reversing course. 

### How humanity organizes on the bleeding edge
With COVID, we believe the first signs of new methods of human organization have become clear: global, remote-first, and self-managing. With this we have tasted the first drops of freedom. 

This we believe was just the beginning. Instead of going back to our 9/5 desk jobs, we believe we can find new methods to organize human efforts. We believe the capacity of each individual, and their ability and willingness to take responsibility for themselves. We believe they can work with a new model where:
- each individual can become a leader
- individuals can work asynchronously, on their own time 
- individuals define their own role, commitment, responsibilities. They take on as much as they please.
- the world and the environment is in constant flux, it is ever dynamic, evolving, changing

All this is made clear in [[3- The Bleeding Edge of Organizations and the Big Problem|The Bleeding Edge of Organizations]].

### Building at the edge: littlefish Foundation
If that was not obvious by now, we're experimenting with this model of organization. Welcome to the experiment :)

On the edge, there are no companies, no governmental organizations, no NGOs. There are just global communities of like minded individuals, interested in similar things, sharing the same values. 

We are an open source project powered by a community of individuals collaborating together to build awesome stuff, for individuals like ourselves. We don't have bosses, yet we need to get things done. 

That is no easy thing and we don't claim to have the answers. All we're doing is running experiments: exploring the possibilities of human collaboration using and building new technologies. Solving for the problems we face, one step at a time.

### **Action** is the foundational key to all success - Pablo Picasso
For things to progress, for us to improve as individuals, for littlefish Foundation to be built, we need **Action**, and lots of it. We found out in the first 3-6 months of littlefish Foundation that forming an online community of like minded people is relatively simple. The difficult part is finding methods to organize the efforts of the community, to work and build together, to move towards common goals. 

We realized, it was all about Action. We needed a way to capture and bring visibility into the contributions of each member of the community, to lower the information barriers in front of self-organization. This was the key insight that got us started. 

See our Catalyst Fund 8 proposal that we then created to get it all kicked off: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404668
