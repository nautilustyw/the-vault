## What can I do to get started?

### Find your reason for being in littlefish Foundation with Ikigai
Ok, now that you feel like you've got a grasp of maybe 10% of what's going on, that's a good time to get involved :D

But then, you ask yourself, what can I do to help around? 

Well, we have a special way of answering that question: Ikigai.

This is a Japanese philosophy meaning **A Reason for Being**. We use a specialized version of the philosophy that comes nowhere near capturing the entire beauty of it. But hey visualizing an entire philosophical concept is not easy ha? Ehem, back to the topic. 

We want you, random person on the internet who is about to become our friend, to find your reason for being here. We want you to do
- what you love
- what you're good at
- what the world needs/what we need
- waht you can be paid for

The Roles of Fish Miro board will show you how: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOWGnhvE=/

Ask for edit access once there, or hop in Newman's calls on Friday's for a guided onboarding session (link in google calendar).
