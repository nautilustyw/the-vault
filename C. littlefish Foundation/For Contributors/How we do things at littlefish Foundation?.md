## littlefish Foundation runs on Action
Decentralized organizations need a way for self-organization to happen. Individuals participate from all over the world, at different time schedules, with varying rates of commitment to the organization. There is no constant interaction between members, tracking the contributions of individuals is difficult. There is no visibility to work done. Who did what gets lost. Information stays in the hands of a few and doesn’t spread effectively. Without visibility, individual efforts don’t align with common goals.  **Action doesn’t count.** 

That's why we conceptualized the [[Action|Action NFT]]. They are the way in which we communicate with each other, the things we have done, the steps we have taken, the work we do. 

As of mid November we're developing our application for littlefish Foundation to run on Actions. Until then, we are playing with the concept in our Discord channel, where we post the Actions we have taken in dedicated channels. This communicates to the rest of the community what we do. 

If you decide to contribute, the final product of your work, and perhaps some intermediate steps will be an Action. Your contributions will live forever onchain.

## Our tools of work
We use all the technology available to us. We research them, compile resources with guides, and additional resources in this Vault for all to use. 

We are currently working on compiling the [[littlefish Tools of Work]], it is an incomplete list of  the tools we use to make work in the decentralized world simpler. 

## Sprints
We run 2 week sprints to align the efforts of our community. littlefish sprints have three parts:
1. Start with a sprint planning meeting, usually held on Mondays. 
2. We keep each other accountable by posting our progress in the `sprint-standup` channel in Discord. 
3. At the end of each sprint, we hold an Action(demo) day where we show what we worked on, then do a sprint review session.

We run these sprints on Dework: https://app.dework.xyz/littlefish-foundatio

You can find the exact dates for the sprints on our google calendar. 

## Self-management
In littlefish Foundation, we run on the belief that each individual has the knowledge and capability to work in freedom, to decide for themselves the best course of action, and to listen to other stakeholders when making those decisions. 

This means each individual is expected to self-manage. To identify opportunities in the organization where they can provide value, and to self-organize with respect to the community and organization.

This guide will get you started on self-management: [[Self Management Primer]]

## The Vault: littlefish's collective knowledge
The Vault, the place you're reading this from, is our collective knowledge base. It is the place where we pool our knowledge. Any research we do, guides we write, process we develop, and implement, should eventually find its way to the Vault. 

We manage the Vault on github: https://github.com/littlefish-foundation/the-vault

To contribute, simply fork the repository, then open a pull request with any changes you wish to make.

Keep in mind this guidance when writing for the Vault: [[How To - Writing for the Vault]]
