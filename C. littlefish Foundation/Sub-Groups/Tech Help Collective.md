The world is confusing to the non-technical person. All this technology around us and nobody to help us understand it. No longer. The THC is here to help.

## Guiding Questions
How do we keep up with developments in an **exponential** **growth** environment?

How do we make sure everyone can use the tools?

## What does the Tech Help Collective do?

### Technology Research
**Aim:** Keeping on top of developments in Cardano, the crypto space, and tools of work that enable decentralized organizations ranging from scheduling tools, video call tools, to AI tools that make our lives simpler.

### Broadcast knowledge

> In vain have you acquired knowledge if you have not imparted it to others. 
> -- Deuteronomy Rabbah

**Aim**: Help the community adopt the tools we use, learn about the technical aspects of blockchains, and littlefish Foundation that they need to know to be capable digital first citizens.

For this the THC does two things: 
1. Create educational content
2. Help others with the tech
