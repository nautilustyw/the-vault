### Software Wallets (Hot Wallets)
* When creating a new wallet only 15-word phrase is available.
	* Make sure that you write down new wallet's words in respective order since the app is going to ask them for confirmation
	* There will be a "spending password" embedded to your extension/app which you will determine. Losing the password only means you won't be able to make transactions on that instance. Deleting the extension/mobile app and restoring with your 15-word recovery phrase will be able to restore your wallet(s).
* Multi-signature and multi asset transaction is available.
* Yoroi supports restoring wallets with 15-word and 24-word recovery phrases and also **paper** wallets
