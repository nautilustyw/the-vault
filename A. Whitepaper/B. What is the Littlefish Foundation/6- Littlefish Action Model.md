Previous: [[5- The Basics - littlefish, colonies and Action]]

Littlefish Action Model describes how individual Actions are aligned towards common goals with littlefish, colonies and Actions.

1 - Everything starts with **colonies**. Littlefish gather around an idea/project/cause/… and start a colony. Colony members have shared goals and undertake activities towards achieving them.

2 - They record these activities using pictures, videos, documents, and other forms of multimedia. These records are recorded on the blockchain as [[13- The Attributes of Action#Proof of Activity PoA|NFTs called Actions]]. These records will live forever on the blockchain. 

3 - Littlefish sell their Actions. These can be bought internally by the colony or externally by others.

  * Same colony. Team members, close associates.
  * Other colonies. A sub/super colony, another colony.
  * Other littlefish. A supporter, investor, collector...

In each case, the rewards are split between the littlefish and the colony according to their reward-sharing agreement.

4 - Rewards incentivize further Action. The signal is strongest for the littlefish and the colony. The rest of the Ocean is also incentivized.

littlefish gets rewarded → littlefish’s desire for further rewards is increased → more Action 

This is a reinforcing feedback loop steps 2 through 4. The more an Action is rewarded, the more it will be incentivized. The less it is rewarded, the less of it will exist. 

It is up to each littlefish to decide what that means.
