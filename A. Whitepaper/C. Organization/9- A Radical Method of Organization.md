Littlefish Foundation takes inspiration from Teal Organization principles:
-   Distributed decision-making     
-   Natural, fluid hierarchies 
-   Self-management of participants

Teal organizations are radically different. Gone are the pyramids of structural oppression, replaced by decentralized networks of self-managing teams:

> All organizations prior to Teal were structured as pyramids for a simple reason: it is a natural consequence of the boss-subordinate relationship. In self-managed organizations, peer commitments replace the boss-subordinate relationship, and the pyramid disappears. Authority is distributed, and work is conducted by decentralized, [self-managing teams or networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_RIQxkM4DW2_J8mF8_spJzs8HbJH1PusJNK4b_ix8k/edit#heading=h.k6jpf3ic859m). 

Without bosses, the pyramid disappears.

This is a scary thought. It was the kings and the generals who made all the decisions, whose histories are written. It was the nobles who lived in castles while the rest towed the fields in their name. It is the wealthy who enjoy life to the fullest while the rest of us work for them. It is the way of the world. Someone tells us what to do. We do it. We get paid. Simple. Comforting. Oppressive. Depressing. 

Pyramids are all we’ve ever known. Without them, where are we left standing? For most of us, it’s difficult to understand. It is unknown. But for some, it is freeing. Hopeful.

> The static hierarchy of the pyramid gives way to fluid natural hierarchies, where influence flows to people who have **the most expertise, passion or interest**. Freed from the rigidity and sluggishness of a command and control structure, Teal organizations can be more responsive and more energized.

Fluid, ever changing hierarchies. Decision-making power in the hands of those who are most affected by the decisions: those with the most expertise, passion or interest. The result is an organization where

In other words:

## Organizational Knowledge 

Building such an organization is no easy task. Organizing in an ever changing, dynamic system is difficult. It’s new. Participants need to adapt. They need to learn, adapt, and share their knowledge. 

This is why it’s absolutely critical to develop an organizational learning culture where:
-   Experiments are run to generate new knowledge,
-   Knowledge spreads efficiently,
-   Individual learning becomes organizational knowledge,
-   Systems are iterated, constantly updated,
-   Accepted practices are standardized.

Modern organizations must take organizational knowledge as a core business function. This includes lowering the barriers of entry for technology, building support processes to communicate and collaborate more effectively, researching emerging technologies, tools, and new methods of governance. Organizations have to keep learning from the collective of human intelligence. They must evolve.
