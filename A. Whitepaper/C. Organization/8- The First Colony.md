The future of organization is here. The pioneers of this future are crypto-native organizations, digital communities and decentralized projects. Littlefish Foundation is one such organization: a decentralized project with a digital community built on the Cardano blockchain.   

We have been building the Littlefish Foundation, experimenting in digital community building since December 2021. We have seen the difficulties of driving community to action. Coordination is difficult. There is information overload. There is no visibility to action. These are the practical problems of coordination all digital communities face. First, we will solve these problems for ourselves. Then we will provide the solutions to everyone else. 

#### Actions of the Littlefish Foundation 
We are the first colony. Let’s delve deeper into what that means. 

Littlefish Foundation is a decentralized project made up of a growing core team and a community of 100+ individuals. The team undertakes activities that help build the Littlefish Foundation. We will document these activities and turn them into Actions. 

Actions emerge from the activities of littlefish. What the Actions of Littlefish Foundation will be is in the activities we undertake. Some of these are:
-   Writing the whitepaper
-   Developing a smart contract
-   Designing UI/UX
-   Planning and running community meetings
-   Creating Art
-   Conducting research. eg. token design, organization building, blockchain tools, etc.

These are the activities of building the Littlefish Foundation. What will be in our Action NFTs is any record/proof of those activities. 

For some of these examples, the Action is clear because there is a clear multimedia output of work available. For “Writing the whitepaper”, the Action is the whitepaper. For “Creating Art”, it is the littlefish art. For “Conducting research” it may be a Medium article, research paper, or a screenshot of a Miro board for an informal research. 

Not all activities have a clear output. For example, what is the Action that represents: “Planning and running community meetings”? It could be a screenshot of a Zoom meeting, the meeting notes, a video of the meeting, the preparations for the meeting, or a combination of these. 

In most use cases, Actions will be created experimentally, optimizing for specific economic and social goals. Different methods to represent Actions will be tried to achieve different goals. Organizational structure and market forces will determine their values.
