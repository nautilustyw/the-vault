## Evidence

### Cardano4Climate (c4c)

As of October 19th we're actively working with c4c to implement a similar onboarding process for c4c community members using Ikigai. We hope it will allow c4c community to more easily identify the needs of the c4c organization and help out where they can.

#### The process

The end goal is to create something like this [Roles of Fish board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOWGnhvE=/) for c4c. For this we're collaborating with the c4c team in several sessions.

On the first workshop, we started with a brainstorming session, where members of c4c to brainstormed about roles, responsibilities, tasks, needs, and pain points.

On workshops 2, 3, and 4, we went through a step by step process to arrive at roles and responsibilities. 

Step 1 - list working groups and proposals of c4c to get us thinking
Step 2 - understanding what roles and responsibilities c4c has by asking these questions
	- Responsibilties: What would a person in this working group/proposal do?
	- Roles: What would you call a person who works in this working group or proposal?
Step 3 - Match Roles to Responsibilities

By the end of workshop 2

In workshops 3 and 4 we went through a more methodical process, where we analyzed each role and matched responsibilities, to refine and finalize.

### Ikigai Survey
We took October to work on a different approach to get the idea of Ikigai out there in time for the Summit. For this we co-created a survey with community members using the concept. Hereâ€™s a high level look at the Miro board where we worked together to brainstorm it all.

![[ikigai-survey1.png]]

It took us several sessions to work on the survey. Our first goal was identifying the objectives of the survey. We brainstormed, then finalized on these three objectives through a vote:

1.  To start collecting Ikigais of people, and to learn from the process
2.  To prime people to think about personal agency and work in a Decentralized Organization
3.  To hype people to come build littlefish Foundation with us

We decided to kick off the survey with 3 yes/no questions from Simon Sinek:
1.  Do you feel excited about going to work?
2.  Do you feel safe being at work?
3.  Do you feel fulfilled with the work you do?

Then we filled the rest of the survey with questions that served the first two objectives. See them color coded below:
